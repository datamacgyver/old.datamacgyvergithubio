<p class="message">
  Good eves! I've been a lot of things in the past, everything from a baker to a lecturer. Today I run the Data Science Team at 
  Proagrica. We will hack at anything but mostly we do farms and farming.

# Current Work

Checkout my github (link to the left). Most of my open-source projects live on [Proagrica's github](https://github.com/OdinProAgrica/) 
though. I look after three repos here:

* hpycc - a python connector for HPCC that makes it useable in a data science workflow
* dapper - an ECL bundle that makes it easier to code in (and read the code for)
* geodapper - not even at beta yet, this gives ECL the geo-functionality of Python's shapely


# Past experience

## Employment
Checkout my linkedIn (link to the left). I've:

* Baked for the Co-op
* Worked in a petrol station
* Sold yogurts for Rachel's Dairy
* Spent 8 years studying ecology
* Spent 2 years lecturing ecology
* Worked for IBM
* Been at Proagrica (an RBI company) since 2016

## Technology

I mainly work in Python and R (no fanwars, please. Right tools, right job). I do a lot in HPCC and SQL but hack around a fair 
bit on AWS and Elastic Search. Bit of machine learning, bit of GIS, some Docker here and there. You get the idea.
